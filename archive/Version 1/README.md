**Features:**
+ The Game only uses python's `tkinter` module for gameplay and was compiled to `*.exe`
  using `pyinstaller`
+ The Game uses multiple threads to play properly, which may not be the best approach
+ The Game reinitializes itself using the `subprocess` module when you lose and press the "Restart" button
